Training data
Test data
Cross-validation
Sampling should be reprensentation of the whole data set.
Stratified sampling
Recombine training and test data sets to retrain the model on the larger data set.
Overfitting
Underfitting

Algorithm:
OLS regression(Ordinary Least Square)


Best subset selection: Fix a number of attribute: Na. Then select the best Na attributes that gives the best model. Test all the Na combinations in N and see their scores.
Forward stepwise regression: Bottom up approch. Take the best attribute, then find attribute that makes the best combination with etc unti Na.
Least-angle regresssion (LARS)
Best subset
Principal Componant regression
Partial least square
Glmnet

Penalized linear regression
Ridge regression
LASSO
ElasticNet Penalty

Gradient descent

Statistical hypothesis test
Null hypothesis
Alternative hypothesis
Statistical significance test 
Type 1 error
Type 2 error

canonical correlation analysis (CCA)
Sparse Solutions: many coefficient in the model are zero

Leakage

Categorical input: one-hot encoder
